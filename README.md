## The problem
Many small local restaurants don't have an ordering/inventory management system due to cost and lack of technical knowledge. This means they use traditional pen and paper to write down the list of items that needs ordering on a particular week which takes a lot of time and often leads to missing items. If an ingredient becomes out of stock before next delivery date, it means customer's food cannot be prepared which results in loss of revenue or they have to purchase this ingredient individually from a local shop which costs a lot more, again losing out on revenue.

## The soluion
Enter GrocerKart. This app reduces the ordering taking process from around 20 minutes to less than 5 minutes, increasing time efficiency by 75%. The app provides a simple and intuitive UI listing all the ingredients needed in the kitchen so that they can be added for a weekly order. This order can then be modified before finalising and sending it over to the supplier. The app also provides a list of past order history so that the restaurant can make informed decisions.
